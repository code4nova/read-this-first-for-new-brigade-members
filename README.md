## How to join Code for NoVA and help propel the movement for better local government

Getting started with the Code for NoVA brigade is pretty dang easy, and doesn't require that you complete all of the following steps *per se*. That said, we do recommend you take the following steps *sequentially* to make the process as seamless as possible, both for you and for us.

If you don't think you can spare five to ten minutes to follow these steps right now or are unsure of any part of this process, no problem; feel more than free to ask any questions in the group or by email.

## JOIN THE OPEN SAVANNAH MEETUP GROUP, THEN RSVP TO THE NEXT UPCOMING EVENT

We use GetTogether to announce and host regular events, from casual meetups to hack nights to technology presentations.

Visit our GetTogether group page at _______________. Select 'Join Group' to join the Meetup group and be notified of future events and RSVP for current events.

?: We use GetTogether to check-in Brigade Members at events. ??? Does Code for America uses Meetup.com attendance numbers to allocate funding to us as a Brigade? So, if you plan on attending an event, help chip-in for the pizza by simply joining and RSVP'ing for the event on Meetup. We'll love you for it.

# **3.** SIGN UP FOR A GITHUB ACCOUNT

We use [GitHub](http://github.com) for project management, file storage, documentation and code version control. If you already have a GitHub account, feel free to skip to Step 2. If you've never heard of GitHub or don't understand why we use GitHub, watch this [quick explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E) for a good introduction. Anyone can use GitHub; it doesn't require **any** programming knowledge. We'll use it as a collaborative tool for *all* our Brigade projects. To create a new GitHub account, take the following steps:

+ Sign-up for an account at [GitHub.com](http://github.com/join).
+ Make sure to create a public-facing username in the sign-up process that you'll be comfortable with displaying as your handle listed for project participation (i.e. we'd advise keeping it simple with something like 'jmercer' if you're name is, say, Johnny Mercer.)
+ Upload an avatar to your GItHub profile if you'd like. We'll use this to display you in our Member Directory page.

# **4.** LOG IN TO OPENSAVANNAH.ORG WITH YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT

*This is so we can list you in our member directory, add you to the mailing list, give you blogging/project creation privileges and more*

?: Is this still the case?: Our homepage, opensavannah.org, is powered by the [BrigadeHub](https://brigadehub.github.io) framework, which is under active development by [Code for San Francisco](http://code4sf.org) and Savannah brigade members, and available as [a repository](http://github.com/opensavannah/brigadehub/) on Open Savannah's GitHub page. BrigadeHub allows us to interact with the APIs (application programming interfaces) of Meetup, GitHub and Medium. Think of an API like a window into an application's data; we're using GitHub's API to pull in project data, Meetup's API to pull in event-related data, etc.

# **6.** COME CHAT WITH THE GROUP ON SLACK

We're currently communicating in real-time on Zulip which is an open source equivalent to Slack

# **7.** MOST IMPORTANTLY, SHOW UP

To make an impact, you've gotta show up. So, don't be a stranger. Come join us at our next event on [Meetup](http://meetup.com/opensavannah)!
