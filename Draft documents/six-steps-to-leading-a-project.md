# Six Steps to Leading a Project (draft)

## Step 1: Identify a need

- Listen to the community for needs.
- Work with the community to flesh out a project; don't ideate or iterate in isolation.
- Very carefully consider ideas that come only from inside the team. While it may be gratifying for someone see their vision become a reality, if it does not solve an existing civic need, this is not the forum for that project.

## Step 2: Build a team

- Agree on channels of communication that work for the members and communicate in an inclusive manner.
- Decide the role(s) each member will play.
  - Play to people's strength and interests.
  - Who will serve as the project lead?
  - Who is ultimately accountable for delivery?
  - Who are responsible for major pieces?
  - Who will help regularly?
  - What roles are missing from the assembled team?

## Step 3: Iterate

- Work in short increments to make minimum viable products
- Regularly seek feedback from stakeholders
- Be flexible with plans to adapt to changing needs
- Resist scope creep
- Consider maintenance costs early on and build to make updates easy to apply

## Step 3: Get the word out

- Brainstorm ways to find and engage others in the community before launch.
- Discuss ideas then decide on a plan that would generate the desired impact.

**Step 6: Release. Maintain. And, possibly, evolve it further.**

- Complete final tests to make sure everything works.
- Decide on a maintenance plan (if it needs one).
- Decide what to measure and what to analyze.
- Plan any future steps.
- Thank everyone who helped get your project off the ground.
